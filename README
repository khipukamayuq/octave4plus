This is my final project submission for Code: Louisville FEWD Jan 2017 session.
If you're in a hurry simply run index.html to view.

The intent here is to build a new website for an existing business named Octave4Plus,
a custom string manufacturer for numerous stringed instruments. Their current site 
is quite old and contains many problems beyond the scope of this course (such as
marketing, branding, etc) which can be seen at 
http://www.garrygoodman.com/octave4plus.com.htm. Poking around here users will see
a lot of repetition from page to page as well as conflicting information about
products and services available. In an effort to reduce these redundancies and better
represent what the company does, my project includes the gist of the company's
offerings on index.html. There is a simple about page explaining how they are 
different and a bit about their history. strings.html can jump to specific interests
by instrument, technical specifications required for ordering, or prototyping needs.
A straight forward contact page with input forms is available. Order page loads a
modal window warning of the need for detailed spec info on user's instruments and
desired configuration of string(s).

My site is built using Bootstrap. Navbar toggles to button at small sizes and below.
Navbar also contains a dropdown to specify path for string info. order.html loads 
modal window with jquery document.ready() call in the head. 

Obviously not ready for launch, will be updating this further at least until the end
of course on March 31, 2017.

Thanks for reading! This is my very first project of my own doing. Constructive 
criticisms and pointers are welcome.
