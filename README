This is my final project submission for Code: Louisville FEWD Jan 2017 session.
If you're in a hurry simply run index.html to view.

The intent here is to build a new website for an existing business named Octave4Plus,
a custom string manufacturer for numerous stringed instruments. Their current site 
is quite old and contains many problems beyond the scope of this course (such as
marketing, branding, etc) which can be seen at 
http://www.garrygoodman.com/octave4plus.com.htm. Poking around here users will see
a lot of repetition from page to page as well as conflicting information about
products and services available. In an effort to reduce these redundancies and better
represent what the company does, my project includes the gist of the company's
offerings on index.html. There is a simple about page explaining how they are 
different and a bit about their history. Both of the above have two break points.
strings.html can jump to specific interests by instrument by using links from index.html
content, anchor buttons at the top of strings.html or via the dropdown menu in the nav.
A straight forward contact page with input forms is available and some imperfect form
validation. Order page loads a modal window via JQuery warning of the need for 
detailed spec info on user's instruments and desired configuration of string(s). The form
beyond the modal has some better validation including regular expression checking
format of user input on the 'Scale Length' field.

My site is built using Bootstrap. Custom styles added including fonts from google,
and social media icons from fontawesome. Stock images gathered for free from pexel.com

Thanks for reading! This is my very first project of my own doing. Constructive 
criticisms and pointers are welcome.
